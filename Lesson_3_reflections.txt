When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

For safety, to have a backup for my work. To enable remore access to my work from home or other locations as necessary. To enable co-workers and other programmers to contribute to my work.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Because modifications on GitHub may be carried out by co-workers or other operators and I can be selective on what changes should be imported in my local repository.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    A fork performs a cloning action within GitHub, so that a repository from a third party is cloned on one's own account. Cloning instead means copying of a repository either within a local server or between GitHuB and the local server. Branches, finally, split the repository in parallel tracks within a repository.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
